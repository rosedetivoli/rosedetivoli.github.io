**ŠUMSKA ZVEZDA**  

Ispleo pauk  
u granja zelenom gnezdu  
nežnu zvezdu.  
Pesma je zatalasa,  
miris zaleluja,  
svetlost je niha:  
Može svakoga časa  
nestati nežna i tiha  
šumska zvezda.  
  
Može je na trn i kamen  
oboriti rose grumen;  
Može je zgoreti u noć  
svica biserna rumen;  
Može joj srce razneti  
leptira koga krilo.  
  
Ali svejedno, prolazi sve  
kao da nije ni bilo:  
Nestaje zvezda  
koju sam plela nad životom,  
nestaće zvezde  
što lepotom večnom  
vrh šuma sijaju.  
  
Svejedno kad:  
da li dogodine ili sad,  
ili posle hiljadu hiljada vekova;  
Svejedno zbog čega:  
da li od zmije, rđavih lekova,  
ili tajnog uzroka kog,  
znam samo, nestaćemo  
i šumski pauk, i ja, i Bog.

**BEING SHOT**  

You'll hear it split-seconds later—the loud afterthought  
Booming among tree trunks like a thunder-crack  
To startle ravens  
And suddenly lift moose-racks dripping with waterlilies  
For miles around—unless you’re too involved.  
Too strangely preoccupied  
With absorbing the impact of this bullet, in sharp contrast  
With your soft flesh and blood, your yielding sinew,  
Your tractable bones.  
If it hasn’t broken your heart or skull, this bit of metal  
May strike you as a blunder, a senseless burden,  
An appalling intrusion  
Into your privacy, to which your body, turning, may take  
Vigorous exception, but soon you’ll feel it growing  
Heavy, then heavier.  
And if you haven’t fallen involuntarily, you may  
Volunteer now and find what ease waits here  
On the forest floor,  
The duff of sword fern and sorrel, of spike moss and beadruby  
That takes without question whatever comes its way,  
While you begin to study  
At first hand now the symptoms of shock: the erratic heartbeat.  
The unexpected displeasure of half-breathing,  
The coming of the cold,  
The tendency to forget exactly why you’re sprawling somewhere  
That has slipped your mind for a moment, seeing things  
In a new light  
Which doesn’t come from the sky but from all loose ends  
Of all your hopes, your dissolving endeavors  
To keep close track  
Of who you are, and where you had started from, and why  
You were walking in the woods before this stranger  
(Who is leaning over you  
Now with a disarming smile) interfered so harshly.  
Not wishing to make yourself conspicuous  
By your endless absence  
And having meant no harm by moving quietly, searching  
Among this second growth of your own nature  
For its first wildness,  
You may offer him your empty hands, now red as his hat,  
And he may grant mercy or, on the other hand,  
Give you as gracefully  
As time permits, as lack of witnesses will allow  
Or your punctured integrity will stand for,  
A graceful _coup de grace_.

**LOST**  

Stand still. The trees ahead and bushes beside you  
Are not lost. Wherever you are is called Here,  
And you must treat it as a powerful stranger,  
Must ask permission to know it and be known.  
The forest breathes. Listen. It answers,  
I have made this place around you.  
If you leave it, you may come back again, saying Here.  
No two trees are the same to Raven.  
No two branches are the same to Wren.  
If what a tree or a bush does is lost on you,  
You are surely lost. Stand still. The forest knows  
Where you are. You must let it find you.  

**David Wagoner, 1971**
