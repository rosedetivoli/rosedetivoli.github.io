_The sea was burning. I can still see this dream-image today, no matter how many grimmer pictures of reality have veiled it since. I would like to knowÂ­ - what am I thinking! like to know? I? but yes, the words are true - I would like to know what unrest, unremarked by me, already caused such dreams amid peace, amid happiness : for
believe it or not, we used to talk of happiness and peace!_
**Cassandra**, Christa Wolf, 1983
