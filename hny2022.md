**The sinking of the Titanic**  
  
FIFTH CANTO  
  
Take what they have taken from you,  
take by force what has always been yours,  
he shouted, freezing in his undersized jacket,  
his hair streaming beneath the davits,  
I am with you, he shouted,  
what are you waiting for? Now  
is the time, pull down the barriers,  
throw the bastards overboard  
with all their trunks, dogs, lackeys,  
the women as well, and even the kids,  
use brute force, use knives, use your bare hands.  
And he showed them the knife,  
he showed them his bare hands.  
  
But the steerage passengers,  
emigrants, all of them, stood there,  
in the dark, took off their caps  
and listened in silence to what he said.  
  
When do you want to take your revenge  
if not now? Or do you mean to say  
that you cannot bear to see blood?  
What about the blood of your children,  
what about your own? And he scratched his face  
and cut his own hands  
and showed them the blood.  
  
But the steerage passengers  
listened to him and did not move.  
Not because he did not speak Lithuanian  
(he didn't), nor because they were drunk  
(they had long since emptied  
their ancient bottles,  
wrapped in coarse handkerchiefs),  
nor because they were hungry  
(though they had not eaten much):  
  
It was something else. It was  
hard to explain.  
They understood quite well  
what he said, but they did not  
understand him. His words  
were not their words. Worn  
by other fears and by other hopes,  
they just stood there patiently  
with their carpetbags, their rosaries,  
their rickety children  
at the barriers, making room  
for others, listening to him, respectfully,  
and waiting until they drowned.

**The breaking up of the ship, the Oskawa, by her crew**  

“Early in the year 1922  
I put on board the six-thousand-ton freighter OSKAWA  
Built four years previously for two million dollars  
By the United States Shipping Board. In Hamburg  
We took on a cargo of champagne and liquor for Rio.  
Since the wages were bad  
We felt the need to drown  
Our troubles in alcohol, so  
Several cases of champagne found  
Their way into the crew’s quarters. In the officers’ quarters too  
Even on the bridge and in the chartroom  
Just four days out of Hamburg you could hear    
The clinking of glasses and the singing  
Of sailors with no care in the world. Several times    
The ship veered off course. Yet still  
Favoured by all kinds of lucky circumstance, we reached  
Rio de Janeiro. When we unloaded, our skipper  
Counted out one hundred fewer cases of champagne. But because he could  
Find no better crew in Brazil  
He had to make do with us. We loaded  
Over a thousand tons of frozen meat for Hamburg.  
Just a few days back at sea we were overcome once more by our troubles  
The bad wages, the uncertain provision for old age, and  
One of us, in his despair, poured  
Too much oil in the furnace, and the fire  
Burst out of the funnel all over the decks, so that  
The boats, bridge and chartroom were destroyed. So as not to sink  
We helped put out the fire, but  
Grumbling about the bad wages (the uncertain future!), we didn’t take  
So much care to salvage what was left of the decks. That would be  
Easy to rebuild, at some expense, and they had  
After all, saved themselves enough on our wages.  
Too much exertion in midlife  
Ages a man quickly and unfits him for life’s struggle.  
So one fine day, because we needed to conserve our energies  
The dynamos, which need the sort of care  
That apathetic folk cannot render, burnt out. Now we were  
Without light. At first we used oil lamps  
So as not to collide with other ships, but  
A tired mate, discouraged by thoughts  
Of a joyless old age, threw the lamps, to save work  
Overboard. About this time, just off Madeira  
The meat began to stink in the refrigerated hold  
Because of the failure of the dynamos. Regrettably  
A distracted crewmember, instead of the bilge  
Pumped out nearly all the fresh water. There was enough to drink  
But no longer enough for the boilers. So we had to  
Use saltwater for the engines and that in turn  
Blocked up the pipes with salt. Cleaning them out  
Took quite a while. And it had to be done seven times.  
Then there was a breakdown in the machine room. Grinning  
We patched it up. The Oskawa  
Limped slowly into Madeira. There  
There was no facility to undertake repairs on the scale  
That were now already necessary. We simply took on  
Water, some lamps and a little oil for the lamps. The dynamos  
Were, it appeared, completely ruined, and consequently  
The cooling system didn’t work and the stink  
Of the rotting meat became intolerable for our  
Frayed nerves; the skipper now  
Only walked the decks armed with a revolver — a symbol  
Of hurtful distrust! One of us, finally  
Enraged by this unworthy treatment  
Diverted a shot of steam into the refrigeration pipes, so that the damn meat  
Would at least be cooked. That afternoon  
The whole crew sat down and painstakingly worked out  
How much this cargo would cost the United States. Before the end of the voyage  
We managed to excel ourselves: off the coast of Holland  
We suddenly ran out of fuel oil, so that  
At considerable expense, we had to be towed into Hamburg.  
The stinking meat caused our skipper a load more trouble. The ship  
Went straight to the boneyard. Any child, we thought  
Could see that our wages had  
Really been too miserly.”

**Ad astram**  
  
I  
  
Spavaj, u redu, važi, spavaj, al bar nešto sni,  
recimo, krilate vrtove; recimo, rep bez mere;  
pa najzad, i sve sveocate venere stare ere,  
ta, i snovi su liv u kojem bogovska misao vri.  
  
Jer, vetar kojim se ovo nesano poglavlje zače;  
trepetne je lepote, na pluća nesvodljive;  
brzine što je nema ni prvi trzaj šljive,  
il tresak vajatskih vrata, ženik kad ih se tače.  
  
Snovi, za koje oni biljani baš mnogo ne mare,  
luzima, barama, osuv nizove trošnih kuća;  
bez traga, bez dima, ledenih još u svanuća,  
  
drže ljiljan i lokvanj prekonoć da ne ostare.  
Šta da se radi tamo, gde samo zlosti rade,  
i vaj pomnožen s vajem ravan je odsustvu nade.  
  
II  
  
Spavaj, niko ti ne smeta, spavaj, al bar nešto sni,  
recimo, koliko robinja imaju ružičini dasi;  
pa najzad, i kakve šubare nakrive Kucovlasi,  
Šta, i snovi su voćke s kojih zvezdani plod zri,  
  
Jer, na Zemlji zemljoverci, i noći velikoga kašlja,  
starinska lira već puca na dve izlišne usne;  
a kad, vas boje plikova, sveža kiša pljusne,  
samo se duga nadnese iznad dremeža buvovašlja.  
  
Vine se katkad košava, svečanost poletnih ptića,  
raznese raskošne naslage trajanja i treme;  
i kao krilati baldahin, il podmlađeno vreme,  
ukne: Dubina Zemljine kore sve plića i plića,  
o čemu da pevaš kad već i lavež nebesima brodi,  
repata pesma Parnase, zvezdare prevashodi.  
  
III  
  
Spavaj, dobro je to po zdravlje, spavaj, al bar nešto sni,  
recimo, rodni kraj da čami, vene i stari;  
pa, kao odjednom nikoše zvezdani pečalbari,  
a snove, brže no gromovi raznose već i psi.  
  
Jer, kročih na tle odzvukom starih niskih ljaga,  
kolenom ne osetih nikakve vezivne varke;  
al, kažu, rđaju zubi, a prsa ko šišarke  
bogovsko nebo kad se zri jedino s nizijskih vlaga.  
  
Lažu, nizijo plodna ženo, lažu da je bolje gore,  
i da zlost i pakost riju jedino tvoje lice;  
lažu, jer samo na tebi niču  aprilske trepavice,  
  
iako dremeži bara zrače sve tvoje jesenje pore.  
Šta li se rodi tamo gde kuju bogovske bajke,  
zvezdani snovi ne mru s lavežom Bala-Lajke?

**Sì amico al freddo sasso è 'l foco interno**  
  
  So kindly to the cold stone is the fire within it  
that if, drawn out from it, the flame surrounds it  
so it's burnt and shattered, it lives in another form,  
itself binding others eternally in place.  
  
  Thus, if it survives the kiln, it can defeat  
summer and winter, and claim a higher price than before,  
as a soul, purified, returns from hell  
to be among the high, worthy others in heaven.  
  
  If, drawn out from me in this way, the fire  
that plays within me secretly, dissolves me,  
burnt and extinguished I can have further life.  
  
  For, if I live, turned into smoke and dust,  
once hardened by the fire I'll be immortal;  
by such gold, not by iron, am I struck.  
  
**Michelangelo Buonarroti, c1542**
