Heroic and humdrum, **Zephyr, deb** (63 min, 2022) is a woman’s life told in nine chapters by an unnamed female narrator. “She lives where she is not. Not what. Not careful.” The woman is called Ida. The sentences are short - they are simple, but the meaning is not. They were written by Gertrude Stein in her novel Ida from 1941.  
  
Preceded by **Song For Three Soldiers** (5 min, 2023) - an anti-war poem perfomed along the banks of the Clyde.
