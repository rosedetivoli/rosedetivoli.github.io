7.30pm on June 14th at The Revelator  
Double bill, performance, Q&A   
  
Heroic and humdrum, "Zephyr, deb" is a woman’s life told in nine chapters by an unnamed female narrator. “She lives where she is not. Not what. Not careful.” The woman is called Ida. The sentences are short - they are simple, but the meaning is not. They were written by Gertrude Stein in her novel Ida from 1941.

Preceded by "Song For Three Soldiers" - an antiwar poem staged along the Clyde.
