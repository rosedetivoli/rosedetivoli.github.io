Heroic and humdrum, a woman's life told in nine chapters by an unnamed female narrator. "_She lives where she is not. Not what. Not careful._" The woman is called Ida. The sentences are short - they are simple, but the meaning is not. They were written by Gertrude Stein in her novel _Ida_ from 1941.
