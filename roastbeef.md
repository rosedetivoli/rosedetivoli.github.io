In a domestic arena, a woman speaks the words written by Gertrude Stein in 1914: _'A sentence of a vagueness that is violence is authority and a mission and stumbling and also certainly also a prison.'_ She struggles through words and language, with food and pleasure, regret, misunderstandings, grasping at many things that were lost and out of reach.
