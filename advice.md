title: Solicited creative advice
permalink: /advice/

In recent years, I have been offering creative advice to those who approach me.  
This is informal, yet focussed and professional advice on your film or creative project.  
I approach each project from the perspective and intentions of the author, without expectations of genre, format, or so-called industry standards.  
I have no preconceptions of 'film language', 'acceptability', 'commercial viability', 'audiences' etc.  
What I do is to bring my experience of two decades of creative work with time-based media, in particular moving-image work, in looking at what you have made or prepared.   
I have extensive experience and knowledge of the diverse histories of film style and expression, many years of fruitful collaboration, many years of watching and enjoying different films.  
I will tell you what I see and what are see as the creative possibilities for the next step.  
This work is not editing, it's not mentoring, it's probably best described as midwifery.  
If you are seeking advice and you think you could trust me to involve me in your creative process, I will honour that trust.  
Feel free to get in touch.
