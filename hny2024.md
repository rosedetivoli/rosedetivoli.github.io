**‘Don’t Mention the Children’**  
by Michael Rosen  
  
Israel bans radio advert listing names of children killed in Gaza  
(Guardian 24.07.14)  
  
Don’t name the dead children.  
The people must not know the names  
of the dead children.  
The names of the children must be hidden.  
The children must be nameless.  
The children must leave this world  
having no names.  
No one must know the names of  
the dead children.  
No one must say the names of the  
dead children.  
No one must even think that the children  
have names.  
People must understand that it would be dangerous  
to know the names of the children.  
The people must be protected from  
knowing the names of the children.  
The names of the children could spread  
like wildfire.  
The people would not be safe if they knew  
the names of the children.  
Don’t name the dead children.  
Don’t remember the dead children.  
Don’t think of the dead children.  
Don’t say: ‘dead children’.

**Children’s Crusade 1939**  
  
War came into Poland  
In 1939  
And there was only a wasteland  
Where house and home had been.  

The armies took brother from sister  
And man from wife. In the fire  
And rubble the child sought the mother  
And couldn’t find her anywhere.  
  
Then nothing came out of Poland  
No newspaper, no post  
But a story, a strange story,  
Circulates in the east.  
  
In an eastern town snow was falling  
When they told the story about  
A children’s crusade and Poland  
Was where it started out.  
  
There were children trailing the long roads  
In troops and passing through  
The shot-to-pieces villages  
Their hungry numbers grew.  
  
They were trying to escape the battles  
And all the nightmare  
And one day come to a country  
Where there’d be no more war.  
  
They had a boy for a leader  
He cheered them when they were low  
But he was worried, he asked himself  
Which way? And did not know.  
  
A girl of eleven dragged along  
A little lad of four  
And to make him a good mother  
All she wanted was no more war.  
  
And on the march was a Jewish boy  
With velvet at his throat  
And he was used to white white bread  
But he found his own two feet.  
  
And two little brothers, great strategists,  
Marched in that campaign.  
  
Stormed an empty shed but lost it   
To the overwhelming rain.  
  
And one lad sidled along apart  
He was the thin grey one.  
  
A terrible blame was eating him:  
He came from a Nazi legation.  
  
A musicmaker was with them, he found  
A drum in a smashed-up store  
But couldn’t play it, the rat-a-tat-tat  
Would have told the world where they were.  
  
They captured a dog  
To kill and eat, they said  
But hadn’t the heart to do it  
So they fed him instead.  
  
They opened a school, a little girl  
Was writing the hard word FRIEND  
(“I” before “E”) on a busted tank  
And never reached the end.  
  
And they did have a concert of music  
By a winter stream that roared  
And the drummer-boy was allowed to drum  
Because he couldn’t be heard.  
  
A girl of twelve, a boy of fifteen  
They had a love affair.  
  
In a house and home the guns had smashed  
She combed his hair.  
  
The love couldn’t live. The cold came on  
Too cold. And tell me how  
The little trees should blossom  
Under so much snow.  
  
And there was even a war  
With another troop of children but  
They left off fighting when they saw  
There was no sense in it.  
  
And while they were still battling  
For a smashed platelayer’s hut  
The story goes one side ran out  
Of things to eat and that  
When the other side heard of this they sent  
Them a sack of spuds because  
The side that has not cannot fight  
As well as the side that has.  
  
Also there was a court case,  
It proceeded uneasily.  
By the shining light of two candles  
They found the judge guilty.  
  
And there was even a helping hand  
(Help never hurt anyone).  

A girl in service showed them  
How to bath a little one   
But she only had two hours  
To teach them the things she knew  
Because her master and mistress  
Wanted seeing to.  
  
And also there was a funeral  
Of a boy with a velvet coat.  
  
Two Poles and two Germans  
Carried the coffin out.  
  
Protestants, Catholics, Nazis  
Were there to close the grave  
And a little socialist gave a speech  
On the future of those still alive.  
So there was faith and hope  
And not only bread and meat  
And let nobody blame them for thieving  
Who gave them nothing to eat  
And let nobody blame the poor man  
Who turned them from his door:  
When it’s fifty it’s not self-sacrifice  
You need for them, but flour.  
  
You come across two or maybe three  
You help them and gladly  
But who can sit them down to eat  
When they are so many?  
  
In a shelled and rubbled farmhouse  
They found a sack of flour.  
  
An eleven-year-old tied her apron round  
And baked hour after hour.  
  
They chopped wood for the oven  
Stirred and kneaded the dough  
But they couldn’t get it to rise because  
None of them knew how.  
  
The best they could, they were heading south.  
South is where you see  
The sun at noon, it is straight ahead  
When there’s any sun to see.  
  
They found a wounded soldier  
In a pine wood. There he lay.  
  
They tended him for seven days  
So he’d show them the way.  
  
He said they should head for Bilgoray  
There was fever in his wound.  
  
He died on them on the eighth day  
And they dug him into the ground.  
  
And of course there were still signposts  
Though muffled under snow  
But all turned round so they didn’t point  
The right way to go.  
  
And that was for military reasons  
And not in cruel fun  
But how should they find Bilgoray  
In the wrong direction?  

They stood around their little leader.  
Snow filled the air.  
He peered ahead and pointed:  
It must be over there.  
  
One night they saw a fire.  
They kept away. And then  
Once three tanks went rolling by  
With human beings in.  
  
And once when they came near a town  
They made a detour round  
And hid by day and walked by night  
Till the town was left behind.  
  
Where south-east Poland used to be  
The fifty-five children  
Were seen in drifts and driving snow  
And then never again.  
  
When I close my eyes I see them  
Trekking on and on and on  
From one farmstead to another  
Shelled-to-pieces everyone.  
  
And above them in the clouds I see  
New larger crowds, they process  
Against the cold winds toilingly  
Homeless, directionless  
Looking for a land of peace  
Without thunder, without the fire  
Not like the land they are coming from  
They are more and more and more  
Vast numbers and in the twilight  
I see that they have become  
The children of every race and clime  
Who want peace and a house and home.  
  
In Poland that January  
A dog was caught, it had  
A cardboard round its scraggy neck  
With writing on that said:  
Please help us, we are lost.  
We can’t find the way anymore.  
We are fifty-five, the dog will lead  
You to where we are  
And if you can’t come, drive him away  
Don’t shoot at him, he is  
The only living creature  
Who knows the way to us.  

The writing was a child’s.  
Peasants read it aloud.  
  
That was a year and a half ago.  
The dog hungered and died.
