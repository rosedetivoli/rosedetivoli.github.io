**‘Don’t Mention the Children’**  
by Michael Rosen  
  
Israel bans radio advert listing names of children killed in Gaza  
(Guardian 24.07.14)  
  
Don’t name the dead children.  
The people must not know the names  
of the dead children.  
The names of the children must be hidden.  
The children must be nameless.  
The children must leave this world  
having no names.  
No one must know the names of  
the dead children.  
No one must say the names of the  
dead children.  
No one must even think that the children  
have names.  
People must understand that it would be dangerous  
to know the names of the children.  
The people must be protected from  
knowing the names of the children.  
The names of the children could spread  
like wildfire.  
The people would not be safe if they knew  
the names of the children.  
Don’t name the dead children.  
Don’t remember the dead children.  
Don’t think of the dead children.  
Don’t say: ‘dead children’.
